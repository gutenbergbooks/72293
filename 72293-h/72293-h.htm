<p class="center no-indent fs130 wsp bold">THE SOCIAL CENTER</p>

<p class="center no-indent wsp">A MEANS OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING</p>


<p>An address delivered by Hon. Woodrow Wilson, Governor of
New Jersey, before the First National Conference on Civic and
Social Center Development, at Madison, Wis., October 25, 1911.</p>

<hr class="r20">

<p>I do not feel that I have deserved the honor of standing
here upon this occasion to make what has been courteously
called the principal address, because five months
ago I did not know anything about this movement. I
have taken no active part in it, and I am not going to assume,
as those who have preceded me have assumed, that
you know what the movement is. I want, if for no other
purpose than to clarify my own thinking, to state as
briefly as possible, what the movement is.</p>

<p>The object of the movement is to make the schoolhouse
the civic center of the community, at any rate in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
such communities as are supplied with no other place of
common resort.</p>


<h2>Ready for Use—The Means of Concerting
Common Life</h2>

<p>It is obvious that the schoolhouse is in most communities
used only during certain hours of the day, those
hours when the rest of the community is busily engaged
in bread-winning work. It occurred to the gentlemen
who started this movement that inasmuch as the schoolhouses
belonged to the community it was perfectly legitimate
that the community should use them for its own entertainment
and schooling when the young people were
not occupying them. And that, therefore, it would be a
good idea to have there all sorts of gatherings, for social
purposes, for purposes of entertainment, for purposes of
conference, for any legitimate thing that might bring
neighbors and friends together in the schoolhouses. That,
I understand it, in its simplest terms is the civic center
movement—that the schoolhouses might be made a place
of meeting—in short, where by meeting each other the
people of a community might know each other, and by
knowing each other might concert a common life, a common
action.</p>


<h2>Spontaneous Development</h2>

<p>The study of the civic center is the study of the spontaneous
life of communities. What you do is to open the
schoolhouse and light it in the evening and say: “Here
is a place where you are welcome to come and do anything
that it occurs to you to do.”</p>

<p>And the interesting thing about this movement is that
a great many things have occurred to people to do in the
schoolhouse, things social, things educational, things political,—for
one of the reasons why politics took on a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
complexion in the city in which this movement originated
was that the people who could go into the schoolhouses at
night knew what was going on in that city and insisted
upon talking about it, and the minute they began talking
about it, many things became impossible, for there are
scores of things that must be put a stop to in our politics
that will stop the moment they are talked of where men
will listen. The treatment for bad politics is exactly the
modern treatment for tuberculosis—it is exposure to the
open air.</p>

<p>Now you have to begin at the root of the matter in order
to understand what it is you intend to serve by this
movement. You intend to serve the life of communities,
the life that is there, the life that you cannot create, the
life to which you can only give release and opportunity;
and wherein does that life consist? That is the question
that interests me. There can be no life in a community
so long as its parts are segregated and separated. It is
just as if you separated the organs of the human body and
then expected them to produce life. You must open wide
the channels of sympathy and communication between
them, you must make channels for the tides of life; if you
clog them anywhere, if you stop them anywhere, why
then the processes of disease set in, which are the processes
of misunderstanding, which are the disconnections
between the spiritual impulses of different sections of men.</p>


<h2>Common Center Essential to Community Life</h2>

<p>The very definition of community is a body of men who
have things in common, who are conscious that they have
things in common, who judge those common things from
a single point of view, namely, the point of view of general
interest. Such a thing as a community is unthinkable,
therefore, unless you have close communication;
there must be a vital inter-relationship of parts, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
must be a fusion, there must be a coördination, there must
be a free intercourse, there must be such a contact as will
constitute union itself before you will have the true course
of the wholesome blood throughout the body.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you analyze some of our communities
you will see just how necessary it is to get their parts together.
Take some of our great cities for example. Do
you not realize by common gossip even, the absolute disconnection
of what we call their residential sections from
the rest of the city? Isn’t it singular that while human
beings live all over a city, we pick out a part, a place
where there are luxurious and well-appointed houses and
call that the residential section? As if nobody else lived
anywhere in that city. That is the place where the most
disconnected part and in some instances the most useless
part of the community lives. There men do not know
their next-door neighbors; there men do not want to know
their next-door neighbors; there is no bond of sympathy;
there is no bond of knowledge or common acquaintanceship.</p>

<p>I am not speaking of these things to impeach a class,
for I know of no just way in which to impeach a class.</p>

<p>It is necessary that such portions of the community
should be linked with the other portions; it is necessary
that simple means should be found by which by an interchange
of points of view we may get together, for the
whole process of modern life, the whole process of modern
politics, is a process by which we must exclude misunderstandings,
exclude hostilities, exclude deadly rivalries,
make men understand other men’s interests, bring all
men into common counsel, and so discover what is the
common interest.</p>

<p>That is the problem of modern life which is so specialized
that it is almost devitalized, so disconnected that the
tides of life will not flow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>


<h2>Means to the Unity of Communities</h2>

<p>My interest in this movement, as it has been described
to me, has been touched with enthusiasm because I see in
it a channel for the restoration of the unity of communities.
Because I am told that things have already happened
which bear promise of this very thing.</p>

<p>I was told what is said to be a typical story of a very
fine lady, a woman of very fine natural parts, but very
fastidious, whose automobile happened to be stalled one
night in front of an open schoolhouse where a meeting
was going on over which her seamstress was presiding.
She was induced by some acquaintances of hers whom
she saw going into the building, to go in, and was at
first filled with disdain; she didn’t like the looks of some
of the people, there was too much mixture of the sort she
didn’t care to associate with—an employe of her own was
presiding—but she was obliged to stay a little while, it
was the most comfortable place to stay while her automobile
was repaired, and before she could get away she had
been touched with the generous contagion of the place.
Here were people of all sorts talking about things that
were interesting, that revealed to her things that she had
never dreamed of before with regard to the vital common
interests of persons whom she had always thought
unlike herself, so that the community of the human heart
was revealed to her, the singleness of human life.</p>


<h2>Worth Any Effort to Promote</h2>

<p>Now if this thing does that, it is worth any effort to
promote it. If it will do that, it is the means by which
we shall create communities. And nothing else will produce
liberty—you cannot have liberty where men do not
want the same liberty, you cannot have it where they are
not in sympathy with one another, you cannot have it
where they do not understand one another, you cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
have it when they are not seeking common things by common
means, you simply cannot have it; we must study
the means by which these things are produced.</p>

<p>In the first place, don’t you see that you produce communities
by creating common feeling? I know that a
great emphasis is put upon the mind, in our day, and as
a university man I should perhaps not challenge the
supremacy of the intellect, but I have never been convinced
that mind was really monarch in our day, or in any
day that I have yet read of, or, if it is monarch, it is one
of the modern monarchs that rules and reigns but does
not govern.</p>


<h2>Common Feeling Essential to Free Government</h2>

<p>What really controls our action is feeling. We are
governed by the passions and the most that we can manage
by all our social and political endeavors is that the
handsome passions shall be in the majority—the passion
of sympathy, the passion of justice, the passion of fair
dealing, the passion of unselfishness, (if it may be elevated
into a passion). If you can once see that a working majority
is obtained for the handsome passions, for the feelings
that draw us together, rather than for the feelings
that separate us, then you have laid the foundation of a
community and a free government and, therefore, if you
can do nothing else in the community center than draw
men together so that they will have common feeling, you
will have set forward the cause of civilization and the
cause of human freedom.</p>

<p>As a basis of the common feeling you must have a mutual
comprehension. The fundamental truth in modern
life, as I analyze it, is a profound ignorance. I am not
one of those who challenge the promoters of special interests
on the ground that they are malevolent, that they
are bad men; I challenge their leadership on the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
that they are ignorant men, that when you have absorbed
yourself in a particular business through half your life,
you have no other point of view than the point of view of
that business and that, therefore, you are disqualified by
ignorance from giving counsel as to the common interests.</p>

<p>A witty English writer once said: “If you chain a man’s
head to a ledger and knock off something from his wages
every time he stops adding up, you can’t expect him to
have enlightened views about the antipodes.” Simply, if
you immerse a man in a given undertaking, no matter how
big that undertaking is, and keep him immersed for half
a life time, you can’t expect him to see any horizon, you
can’t expect him to see human life steadily or see it whole.</p>


<h2>Means to Liberal Education</h2>

<p>I once made this statement that a university was intended
to make young people just as unlike their fathers
as possible. By which I do not mean anything disrespectful
to their fathers, but merely this, by the time a man is
old enough to have children in college, his point of view
is apt to have become so specialized that they would better
be taken away from him and put in a place where their
views of life will be regeneralized and they will be disconnected
from the family and connected with the world.
That, I understand to be the function of education, of the
liberal education.</p>

<p>Now a kind of liberal education must underlie every
wholesome political and social process, the kind of liberal
education which connects a man’s feeling and his comprehension
with the general run of mankind, which disconnects
him from the special interests and marries his thought
to the common interests of great communities and of great
cities and of great states and of great nations, and, if possible,
with that brotherhood of man that transcends the
boundaries of nations themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>Those are the horizons to my mind of this social center
movement, that they are going to unite the feelings and
clarify the comprehension of communities, of bodies of
men who draw together in conference.</p>


<h2>Conference Always Modifies and Improves
Thought</h2>

<p>I would like to ask if this is not the experience of every
person here who has ever acted in any conference of any
kind. Did you ever go out of a conference with exactly
the same views with which you went in? If you did, I am
sorry for you, you must be thought-tight. For my part I can
testify that I never carried a scheme into a conference without
having it profoundly modified by the criticism of the
other men in the conference and without recognizing
when I came out that the product of the common council
bestowed upon it was very much superior to any private
thought that might have been used for its development.
The processes of attrition, the contributions to consensus
of minds, the compromises of thought create those general
movements which are the streams of tendency and the
streams of development.</p>


<h2>Will Make Easier Solution of Great Problems</h2>

<p>And so it seems to me that what is going to be produced
by this movement,—not all at once, by slow and tedious
stages, no doubt, but nevertheless very certainly in the
end,—is in the first place a release of common forces now
undiscovered, now somewhere banked up, and now somewhere
unavailable, the removal of barriers to the common
understanding, the opening of mind to mind, the clarification
of the air and the release in that clarified air of
forces that can live in it, and just so certainly as you release
those forces you make easier the fundamental problem
of modern society, which is the problem of accommodating
the various interests in modern society to one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>


<h2>Adjustment Necessary to Liberty</h2>

<p>I used to teach my classes in the university that liberty
was a matter of adjustment and I was accustomed to illustrate
it in this way; when you have perfectly assembled
the parts of a great steam engine, for example, then when
it runs, you say that it runs free; that means that the adjustment
is so perfect that the friction is reduced to a
minimum, doesn’t it, and the minute you twist any part
out of alignment, the minute you lose adjustment, then
there is a buckling up and the whole thing is rigid and
useless. Now to my mind, that is the image of human
liberty; the individual is free in proportion to his perfect
accommodation to the whole, or to put it the other way,
in proportion to the perfect adjustment of the whole to
his life and interests.</p>

<p>Take another illustration; you are sailing a boat, when
do you say that she is running free, when you have thrown
her up into the wind? No, not at all. Every stick and
stitch in her shivers and you say she is in irons; nature
has grasped her and says: “You cannot go that way;”
but let her fall off, let the sheet fill and see her run like a
bird skimming the waters. Why is she free? Because
she has adjusted herself to the great force of nature that
is brewed with the breath of the wind. She is free in
proportion as she is adjusted, as she is obedient, and so
men are free in society in proportion as their interests are
accommodated to one another, and that is the problem of
liberty.</p>


<h2>Analysis Accomplished—Now Assembled</h2>

<p>Liberty as now expressed is unsatisfactory in this
country and in other countries because there has not been
a satisfactory adjustment and you cannot readjust the
parts until you analyze them. Very well, we have analyzed
them. Now this movement is intended to contribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
to an effort to assemble them, bring them together,
let them look one another in the face, let them reckon
with one another and then they will coöperate and not before.</p>

<p>You cannot bring adjustment into play until you have
got the consent of the parts to act together, and then when
you have got the adjustment, when you have discovered
and released those forces and they have accommodated
themselves to each other, you have that control which is
the sovereignty of the people.</p>

<p>There is no sovereignty of the people if the several
sections of the people be at loggerheads with one another;
sovereignty comes with coöperation, sovereignty comes
with mutual protection, sovereignty comes with the quick
pulses of sympathy, sovereignty comes by a common impulse.</p>

<p>You say and all men say that great political changes
are impending in this country. Why do you say so?
Because everywhere you go you find men expressing the
same judgment, alive to the same circumstances, determined
to solve the problems by acting together no matter
what older bonds they may break, no matter what former
prepossessions they may throw off, determined to get
together and do the thing.</p>


<h2>Enlightened Control in Place of Management</h2>

<p>And so you know that changes are impending because
what was a body of scattered sentiment is now becoming
a concentrated force, and so with sympathy and understanding
comes control, for, in place of this control of
enlightened and sovereign opinions, we have had in the
field of politics as elsewhere, the reign of management,
and management is compounded of these two things,
secrecy plus concentration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>You cannot manage a nation, you cannot manage the
people of a state, you cannot manage a great population,
you can manage only some central force; what you do,
therefore, if you want to manage in politics or anywhere
else is to choose a great single force or single group of
forces, and then find some man or men sagacious and
secretive enough to manage the business without being
discovered. And that has been done for a generation in
the United States.</p>

<p>Now, the schoolhouse among other things is going to
break that up. Is it not significant that this thing is being
erected upon the foundation originally laid in
America, where we saw from the first that the schoolhouse
and the church were to be the pillars of the Republic?
Is it not significant that as if by instinct we
return to those sources of liberty undefiled which we find
in the common meeting place, in the place owned by
everybody, in the place where nobody can be excluded, in
the place to which everybody comes as by right?</p>

<p>And so what we are doing is simply to open what was
shut, to let the light come in upon places that were dark, to
substitute for locked doors, open doors, for it does not make
any difference how many or how few come in provided
anybody who chooses may come in. So as soon as you
have established that principle, you have openings, and
these doors are open as if they were the flood gates of
life.</p>


<h2>Faith In People Justified</h2>

<p>I do not wonder that men are exhibiting an increased
confidence in the judgments of the people, because wherever
you give the people a chance such as this movement
has given them in the schoolhouse, they avail themselves
of it. This is not a false people, this is not a people
guided by blind impulses, this is a people who want to
think, who want to think right, whose feelings are based<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
upon justice, whose instincts are for fairness and for the
light.</p>

<p>So what I see in this movement is a recovery of the
constructive and creative genius of the American people,
because the American people as a people are so far different
from others in being able to produce new things, to
create new things out of old.</p>


<h2>This Movement Fundamentally American</h2>

<p>I have often thought that we overlook the fact that the
real sources of strength in the community come from the
bottom. Do you find society renewing itself from the
top? Don’t you find society renewing itself from the
ranks of unknown men? Do you look to the leading families
to go on leading you? Do you look to the ranks of
the men already established in authority to contribute
sons to lead the next generation? They may, sometimes
they do, but you can’t count on them; and what you are
constantly depending on is the rise out of the ranks of unknown
men, the discovery of men whom you had passed
by, the sudden disclosure of capacity you had not dreamed
of, the emergence of somebody from some place of which
you had thought the least, of some man unanointed from
on high, to do the thing that the generation calls for.
Who would have looked to see Lincoln save a nation? Who
that knew Lincoln when he was a lad and a youth and a
young man—but all the while there was springing up in
him as if he were connected with the very soil itself, the
sap of a nation, the vision of a great people, a sympathy
so ingrained and intimate with the common run of men
that he was like the People impersonated, sublimated,
touched with genius. And it is to such sources that we
must always look.</p>

<p>No man can calculate the courses of genius, no man can
foretell the leadership of nations. And so we must see to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
it that the bottom is left open, we must see to it that the
soil of the common feeling of the common consciousness
is always fertile and unclogged, for there can be no fruit
unless the roots touch the rich sources of life.</p>

<p>And it seems to me that the schoolhouses dotted here,
there, and everywhere, over the great expanse of this nation,
will some day prove to be the roots of that great
tree of liberty which shall spread for the sustenance and
protection of all mankind.</p>
